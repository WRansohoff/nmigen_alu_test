# Simple nMigen ALU

This is an nMigen implementation of the educational ALU which is used in MIT's edX 6004.1x and 6004.2x free online courses.

I wanted to brush up on digital logic since it's been a few years since college and I want to design a minimal implementation of the RISC-V ISA in nMigen. So I figured I'd follow along with some online classes using nMigen alongside the provided simulators as a learning exercise.

The 6004.1X and 6004.2X courses are archived, but you can still watch the lectures and see the example problems here:

[6004.1x](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:MITx+6.004.1x_3+3T2016/course/)

[6004.2x](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:MITx+6.004.2x_2+3T2016/course/)


And you can do the lab assignments here, even though they are no longer available on the edX website:

["Computation Structures" course website](https://computationstructures.org/)

The .1x course mostly covers the background of how digital circuit design works at a high level, but the last few modules cover basic pipelining and describes a simple ALU (which is implemented here along with the same test cases used in the course's lab modules.)

The .2x course looks like it covers how to design a more complete SoC, but I'm still working through that one.
